- Puts mob values inside Mobs structure
- Plans to add an easy, medium, hard mode to the game using these structures
- Added New Function called Game, which runs through the dungeon vs 3 different games previously due to the different classes; tl;dr solved by structures lower amount of code
- Added Heroes Structures for new game function 
	- Heroes uses an enumarted data structure to 
- Many New Things Added this patch over 500 lines of code changed
- Overall Change deemed a waste of time, as code kept breaking with the structures and pointers
- Basically on the checkout sheet finished most of structures and pointers
- Honestly, Should have put this into multiple verision would have saved me a lot of trouble finding errors, however I had an idea on how to minimize code and I couldn't stop.
